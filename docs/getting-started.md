Using inline editing we can simply set a blog on Next JS.

Tina Starter Alpaca is a NextJS documentation responsive theme, customizable, and hosted on Vercel.

Go to [https://tina-starter-alpaca.now.sh](https://tina-starter-alpaca.now.sh/ "https://tina-starter-alpaca.now.sh/") to give it a spin. You can edit your content from the website just like on tinacms.org.
